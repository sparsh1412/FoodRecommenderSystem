This is a Food Recommender System.
It recommends food items based on your previous ratings of the food item that you have had.
The restaurnts are the local ones that are present in the college campus.
The dataset is self made based on the rating filled by various people for the items they have had.

I have used the LightFM library.
The recommendtaions are made with the concept of Matrix Factorization.
